  <h1 id="title">Texas SCDC</h2>

  <h4>February 22nd, 2020</h4>		


  Thursday: Although this was technically the first day of DECA SCDC, I started off the day as usual. After a quick 4:30 swim, I headed off to school for a busy day. In First Period, AP World History, we were supposed to bring our textbooks, but because I had to lug whatever I brought around my hotel, I decided not to bring it(and I didn’t want to read it anyway). Instead, I decided it was the perfect time to start cramming for DECA. During 2nd Period, I took an absolute dub on my English retest. On the first test, I got an 87, so I decided to give it a go again, and I ended up feeling pretty good about it. In 3rd period, Pre-AP computer science, we were supposed to work on our projects, but again, I continued cramming various terms, ratios, indicators, and more. From there, my final period of the day was AP Statistics. Here we took a test on confidence intervals, probabilities, and more using means. While my teacher takes eons to grade, I believe I did well.

After 4th period, we headed straight to the loading dock to board the busses. First, I got my luggage which I dropped off in the morning, picking up a complementary chick-fil-a sandwich on the way. From there, we took a group picture with all of College Park DECA. Finally, we loaded our luggage onto the busses, and departed from our school.

After a long, 4 hour, ride to Fort Worth, we were stopped just short of our destination. Less than one mile away from the hotel, the bus in front of us broke down. Bring that we were in a bus and not a car, maneuvering around the other bus was proving to be quite difficult. When we reached the hotel, we had to head to opening sessions pretty quickly. After Me, Koushal, Suyog, and Vali left our stuff in a friends room, we changed into our suits and headed out to the convention center. At the opening session, various schools, chapter advisors, and officers were honored with various awards. Basically, it was super boring, although Esha did go and get some awards for our school. By the time the opening session was over, it was already pretty, late, but we headed back to our room. Finally, at around 9:45, we decided it was high time to get dinner, but curfew was at 10:30, so we didn’t have much time. Sadly, due to confusion on turns, poor service, and my friends using APPLE MAPS, as well as several of the restaurants we found being closed or having 30+ minute wait times, it was 10:25 and we didn’t have any dinner yet. Exhausted and frustrated after running all over Fort Worth, we gave up and ran back to the hotel to be on time for room checks. At 10:29, Suyog felt bold enough to go to a different room to get some ramen noodles, bachade we only had snacks. However, just before he came back, the room check people came to our room. I stalled in effectively by saying Suyog was in the restroom, which he obviously wasn’t because the bathroom door was open. Just as the inspectors were getting suspicious, Suyog burst out the elevator, running towards our room, and narrowly avoiding punishment. With all that out of the way, we considered studying for tomorrow’s competition, before unanimously deciding, “nah”. Instead, we started to play music on Suyog’s Bluetooth speaker, a Bose Soundlink Mini, which has a crazy amount of bass. On top of that, we found that putting the speaker in the drawer increases tha bass even more. The only problem was, apparently other hotel guests don’t appreciate fire beats shaking the entire building at 2:00 am. As such, a police officer showed up to the door of our room and told us to turn down the music. We did. At this point, we decided it was high time to sleep.

After missing my alarm on Friday morning, I only rode to the sound of my phone ringing with my sister/DECA partner calling. I realized I missed our morning meetup time by 10 minutes already, and I hadn’t even woken up yet, and I also had to wear my suit for competition. As you would expect, I shot out of bed, and madly started to get ready. We went to the corner bakery, which I had gone to with my roommates the previous night for an evening snack. Here we discussed competition plans while waiting to go to our room. Finally, we decided it was late enough to go to the competition room. While it took a long time to find our line, the wait itself was even longer, strengthened with our excited nervousness. After what seemed like forever, we were finally called to our competion. While the topic we were given, Credit Card fraid, was not one known subject to either of us, we did the best we could with our role play. The second we walked out of the line of sight of the judge, I instantly stopped caring about DECA, and was determined to have as much fun as possible. After networking with a couple randos, Esha and I ran into some of our friends in her grade. While one of our friends was doing volunteer hours, she was just wrapping up, so we decided to go to the Fort Worth water gardens. Here, we walked around the various attractions, fountains, spraying jets, pools and more, while also talking about whatever came to our minds. The main attraction was a... it hard to explain. Just watch the videos.

Finally, the group split up to prepare for competion, eat, and all sorts of other things, so I went back to my hotel room and waited for Koushal and Suyog to finish up their role plays, since Vali was going to leave soon anyway. Once those 2 arrived in the hotel room, we decided to go to the Water Gardens again, since they hadn’t gone yet. This time, I felt more like a tour guide, which was cool. We also decided to relax on top of one of the structures called, the mountain, which was very refreshing because it was sunny and chilly at the same time.

From here, Koushal, Suyog and I decide to head back to the hotel, when we saw some kids playing with a frisbee. As the high level intellectuals we are, we couldn’t resist going back in the convention center to pick up some frisbees and balls of our own. After that, we played catch for about an hour, as it slowly turned into a demonstration of who could throw the furthest(it was Koushal). Finally, at around 3:30, we decided to get some “lunch”. We went to a pizza restaurant, where we where definitely scammed knowingly. Apparently, the extra-large cheese pizza is 22 dollars, but if it is half cheese, half margarita, it was 32 dollars. None of us felt like arguing with a dude with spotty English, so we just took the L. The pizza was very large, and filling. At 4:20, we were told to get ready again to hear the state officer candidates give their speeches. We tried our best to avoid going, but in the end, we had to suit up again and head out. At around 7:30, the speeches were, thank god, finally over, and that’s when the real fun started.

Apparently, this was year 2 of WrestleMania, which I missed last year. We started with a Bang, with Yahya and Sanat, who were in grossly different weight classes, duke it out in a rematch. Yahya won. Then Neel and Suyog decided to square off. Neel won, easily. Then, the two biggest guys in the room, on varsity football, both over 230 pounds, decided to go at it themselves. They were so evenly matched, that the just ended up giving up once they were both tired. In an unsuspecting turn, Koushal and Will wrestled, and while it was close, Koushal came out with a win. Finally, it was Nathan and Rawson, which ended with a quick and easy victory by Nathan. After that, WrestleMania was postponed until next year, but the party continued, now with a gang of Indian dudes dancing to dhoom machale and hrithik roshan in dhoom 2. While it was definitely lit, curfew was approaching yet again. Once we came to our room and settled down, we tried to watch a movie ourselves, eventually settling on the Blair Witch Project, which bored us to death if anything, and at 12:00, we went to bed.

However, we definitely over-estimated ourselves with a 5:00 alarm. While all our phones, we also collectively decided, “Hell no, I’m not waking up”. The only problem is, none of us set another alarm, and we had to be dressed and packed at 8:15. Long story short, our alarm was the knocking on our door by our chaperones. I don’t think I have ever dressed that quickly in my life, but somehow we were all suited up in just minutes. Rushing to the award ceremony, I began to utilize the Law of Attraction, as I visualized receiving my award almost a million times before it happened. Our event was one of the last to get called up, and at that point I had already seen hundreds of people receive their awards, and I was more than ready to get one of my own. When the first called us down the stage as a possible ICDC candidate, I was already over the moon. The happiness and pride I felt when they called my name as a winner simply can’t be described in words. At that point, our chapter went back to the hotel and packed up to leave. On the bus, we had a shady lunch from Schlotzskys, we started the four hour drive back home.

AOnce home in Houston, my mom, sister, and I celebrated our fun with a banana split. Now, it is 11:30. I have lots of homework to do tomorrow, but I did clean up all my stuff from the trip. I can’t wait to seize the opportunity to win at ICDC, and cement myself as G of The Woodlands College Park DECA. My eyes are definitely dropping now. Jay out.
