  <h1 id="title">Why bother with the SAT?</h2>

  <h4>August 19th, 2020</h4>		


For every high scholar in America, as well as many foreign students, the SAT is a big deal. For me personally, I took my first official SAT in 7th grade, as part of one of my school’s programs. From there, in 8th grade, I took the PSAT 8/9, which serves as a warm-up of sorts, which will predict what you get on the actual SAT. The same goes for the highschool PSAT, which I have taken in 9th and 10th grade. The official PSAT, used to determine whether or not you become a National Merit Scholar, is taken in 11th grade. This is the same year that many students take their SAT, so if they mess up, or get a lower score than they had hoped for, they have time to retake the test before college apps in 12th grade.
  But why is the SAT so important, that it is stressed by parents, teachers, and schools for so many years? Well, in order to understand, you have to look at it from the college’s perspective. If you are an admissions officer at a university, you only have so many numerical metrics to decide whether or not to admit someone. These include AP test scores, Class grades, GPA, and Class Rank. Of those, several schools, especially in lower-income areas, don’t provide as many AP classes, so poorer students are at a disadvantage. In terms of GPA and class rank, many high schools calculate these values differently. Some use a non-weighted scale, others use a weighted-scale(keep in mind, there are several types of weighted scales as well), and still other schools have abolished things like class rank and valedictorian, to lower stress and competition amongst students. And finally, class grades. Every single teacher across the nation grades differently than the others, so if Jim from Iowa got a 99 in his PreCalculus class, that doesn’t necessarily mean that he is better at PreCalculus than Pablo from Massachusetts, who got a 93. This leaves only standardized tests, like the SAT, ACT, and PSAT.
  While the SAT has been shown to be biased by factors such as household income, race, gender, school funding, etc. it has been shown that your SAT score is a good predictor of your college grades. This enables colleges to use SAT scores as the first barrier of entry, to automatically reject applications from students whose scores fall below their set boundary. For example, the average SAT score of a Harvard student is between 1460 and 1580(max score is 1600). This means, if you have a 1310 SAT score(@hasanminhaj), then you might as well forget applying.
  This means that as a highschool student, which I currently am, your SAT score is extremely important, as it sets the bar to which schools you can even apply to, and which ones are out of your league.
    Personally, I am a Junior, and I am scheduled to take my test on August 29, 2020, which is only 10 days away. I am hoping to get a 1600, but I haven't yet got that on any practice tests. While I consistently miss 0 questions in the Math sections, I am still missing a couple in the Reading and Writing Sections. I hope to get at least 3 practice tests with a 1570+ score before I take my official test. At this point though, the only thing I can do is focus, practice, and pray.
  Wish me luck…
