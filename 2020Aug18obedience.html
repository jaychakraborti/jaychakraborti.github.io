  <h4>August 18th, 2020</h4>		


 I was thinking today about what freedom means, as it can mean many things to many people. For some, freedom means a democratic government, or at the very least, a republic. In that case, anyone living in North America, Europe, India, etc. can be considered free, as they don’t have to bow to a supreme ruler, dictator, or monarch. To others, freedom can mean financial freedom. That means that they have enough money to where they don’t have to worry about their monthly bills, expenditures, etc. and that money is no longer a limiting factor in what they choose to do. For example, if Elon Musk decided to go to Paris for 2 weeks, his schedule, meetings, plans, etc might be limiting factors, but money would not be. In that case, to be free, you have to attain a certain income/net worth.
  But one alternative idea of freedom is how many people you are individually accountable too, have to listen too, and are essentially, controlled by. A corporate employee is accountable to their boss, higher levels of management, and the government. On a daily basis however, likely the only person that they take orders from is their boss, as the other 2 are less frequent. Then let's take an entrepreneur, who is in full ownership, or majority ownership of their company. For example, Mark Cuban answers maybe to his wife, his colleagues, and the government. Out of those 3, his wife/family and colleagues cannot tell him explicitly what to do, as he controls the income for the business, and his wife is more of a partner than a boss. And of course, everyone answers to the government.
    Well, today I was considering my own levels of freedom, under that definition. Recently, my grandmother has arrived at my house, which means that in my own family, I am directly accountable to both of my parents, as well as now my grandmother. Outside of the house, I have 7 classes, of which each teacher, as well as my school principal, headmaster, and counselors, all have direct control over me, in the sense that if I am given an assignment or task by them, I have to finish that assignment/task by their given deadline. Failure to do so will result in some form of punishment. 
      To be honest, sometimes, like today, this many layers of control really get on my nerves(sorry if this seems like I'm just whining, but  I probably am). Anyway, no one asked for my sob story, so I'll just cut it off there, and ask you, how many people do you answer to in your own life?
