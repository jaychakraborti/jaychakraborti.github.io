  <h1 id="title">Last Day of Summer</h2>

  <h4>August 11th, 2020</h4>		


Today is the last day of school before I start my junior year of high school. I am working on a physics packet, and still have to read a book, and finish a calculus packet before 7:00 AM tomorrow. Why not start a journal now too? Anyway, I think today is a good day to do a quick summer/ quarantine recap. For the first couple weeks, from March - June, I still had school, but I couldn't get a lower grade than I had in the 3rd quarters. Since I got all Aâ€™s in the 3rd quarters, that meant I could do jackshit for the rest of the year, and still get an A for the semester. So, basically, that's what I did. From there, in June, I started making videos on Tiktok. Now, I have made over 100 videos, and have over 5500 followers. While I have taken a temporary break, I will start posting again tomorrow. Aside from that, I am trying to lose fat, and have been cutting out junk food and exercising more than normal. My main goals right now are to establish a morning and nightime routine that I do consistently everyday. I also am trying to get into Hrithik Roshan level shape. I am also trying to start a content empire, with millions of followers on Tiktok. Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Also also, I am trying to get ahead in my studies and prepare for some academic competitions. And my final also is that I am trying to get into coding and build some companies and apps. Alright, I am heading out now, otherwise, I might never finish these assignments.
