  <h4>August 16th, 2020</h4>		


Today was a special day, in the sense that not only is my school just beginning, but my grandmother just arrived at our home, and today is my parents 21st marriage anniversary! We celebrated today like kings!

At lunch, we ate biryani and raita, with sides of onion, hot sauce, and more.

Later on, before dinner, we decided to take a photo shoot, where my whole family and I dressed up nicely, and took several photos, in all sorts of combinations of people, just to remember how great today was. To round off today‚Äôs meals, we at tandoori chicken, homemade bread, hummus, and guacamole(truly, a globetrotting meal üòä).

While we were eating, we were also discussing, and it came up in conversation, that our whole life, is really just an accumulation of small decisions, actions, and moments. For example, if you have a bunch of bananas, and a box of fruit loops, both in your kitchen, but everyday you decide to eat fruit loops, thinking you will have bananas later, then 20 years in the future you will think of yourself as a Fruit Loops eater(with the gut to prove it). Or, if you are a parent, who, working late on a Friday, decide that you have to stay at work for 30 more minutes, and you end up missing your kid‚Äôs soccer game. You think, ‚ÄúI missed it once, but next time, I will go, and it will be amazing!‚Äù 30 years later, you don‚Äôt talk much with your kid, you don‚Äôt know what they are doing, and you wonder where it all went wrong.
This reminds me of an episode of one of my favorite animated shows, Avatar: The Last Airbender. In the episode, Team Avatar crashes, and gets stranded in a massive swamp. While their adventures in the episode are hilarious, thrilling, and blood-curdling, at the end of the show, the team finds out that the whole swamp is actually just one massive tree! In fact, the tree is so massive, that its roots cross the whole world, and it is even partially sentient!

Of course, this is just a TV show, but it serves as a metaphor for life in general. In order to truly live a satisfactory life, you must pay attention to your smallest habits, behaviors, and relationships, and work to form them into what you desire.
