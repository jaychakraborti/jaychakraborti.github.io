  <h1 id="title">2nd Week of Online School</h2>

  <h4>August 17th, 2020</h4>		


  Today is Monday, August 17th, of the terrible year 2020. It is also the second week of school, which started last Wednesday, and the first full week of school. I think now is a good time to discuss my experience with online school, its pros and cons when compared to normal school, and problems I have experienced.
First things first, I should identify what tools my school has decided to use. My school district is using Canvas, from a company called instructure, as its main online platform. I know other schools use other platforms, such as Blackboard, Google Classroom, etc. However, my school district had been using Canvas well before 2020, so it makes sense to use a platform both teachers and students are familiar with. Inside canvas, each teacher/course has their own page, and each page is customized by the teacher. They have a home page, which usually serves as a welcome page, with class supplies, useful links, etc. From there, homework and daily assignments are in a Modules Tab, and some grades can be seen in the Grades tab. For live conferencing, Canvas uses BigBlueButton conferences, and those can also be accessed for individual classes. The Canvas software also has a calendar, where you can add events, and teachers from all of your classes can add events, due dates, etc. There is also an inbox section, which uses the district provided email, but you don’t have to type anyone's email, just their name. Aside from Canvas, we also use Pearson for many MyLab Assignments, Google Drive, ViewIT for viewing all your grades, your schedule, your future classes, etc. and Naviance for GPA, class rank, and college lists. This year, the district added an SSO, or single sign on, so you only have to remember one set of a username and password, and you are automatically signed in to all the aforementioned programs, as well as several others.
Now, onto the pros and cons of online school. First, the pros. The school told us before the year started, that in terms of live conferencing, lessons, classwork, etc. the school day had been condensed from 7 hours, to 4 hours, by  cutting out lunch breaks, advisory, passing period, as well as any lost time within the classroom, such as when entering or getting ready to leave. To be honest, for me, although this might change later, the total amount of live sessions and video lessons comes out to about 1 hour a day. Admittedly, I watch lectures at 2x speed(laziness), and I usually mess around or do HW during live sessions. Including homework and assignments, that usually takes another 2 -3 hours. So in total, I spend about 3 - 5 hours a day doing directly school related activities. Given that all my 7 classes are AP(Physics 1, Art History, Seminar, Calculus BC, English III, Comp. Sci A, and Chemistry), this is a massive pro, since on a normal school day, I wake up at 5:00 AM, reach by 7:00 AM, have class till 2:35:PM, arrive home at 4:30 PM, at which point I am usually finished with my HW. This means that while having much harder classes than last year, I am spending 6.5 hours less per day at school(11.5 to 5). However, this could change as the year goes on, and more assignments pile up. Another pro, is that all assignments are due at 11:59 pm, not during a specified class period. That means if I want to make a Youtube video in the evening, I can finish all my assignments before noon. But if I sleep in and laze around, I can finish my assignments later in the evening. This makes school less of a hassle, and gives you more freedom in terms of planning your day.
Now, onto the cons. For one, each teacher organizes their page differently, notifies you of assignments differently, and some even use different conference software than others. This means that it is kind of hard to find assignments for some teachers, and it is difficult to keep track of what you have to do in a day. Another con is the erratic timing of the live conferences. On any day, I could have a 1 hour conference at any time slot from 7AM to 3PM, really whenever the teacher wants. This makes it difficult to structure your day, and because you have to have your camera on, and the information is live, there is a lot of lost minutes in normal conversation, and it is difficult to work on other tasks during a conference, because you don’t want to miss anything, and unlike a recorded video, you can’t rewind, go forward, or use 2x speed. Overall, I feel like the conferences are pointless on a daily basis, and all teachers should pre-record video lessons instead, with maybe sporadic live conferences as need be. The final con is maybe the biggest. To be honest, the only real reason I enjoy going to school is to talk with people and socialize. Because you are literally forced into a situation where you spend months next to the same group of people, and you all have a topic you can talk about, school, it is easy to make friends, crack jokes, and have a good time. Additionally, you can ask questions to your friends, work together on assignments, get reminded if you miss something, and basically have each other's backs. This is a lot more difficult to do when you have to virtually text them.
To summarize my overall feelings, I should rate online school out of 10. I would give it 4.5 stars. Overall, to me at least, the lack of social connection with friends, peers, and teachers, outweigh the time saved. Basically, if the pandemic ended tonight, you could count on me to be at school first thing in the morning tomorrow.
