  <h4>August 23rd, 2020</h4>		


  First things first, I would like to start out with a life update. Tomorrow will be the first day of my third week of online school, and at this point, the assignments/workload is becoming more evident. In my Freshman year, I took 1 AP Class, AP Human Geography, which also has been my easiest class. Basically, not only from my perspective now, but also from my perspective then, that year was a breeze. I could finish all my day’s assignments before I even came home from school. This was similar last year, as although I took 3 AP classes, they were pretty similar to a regular level class, and weren’t too difficult. Those 3 were AP World History, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Statistics. In fact, I had so much free time that I was able to self-study for AP Environmental Science and AP Psychology, with plenty of time left over to browse Reddit and Youtube. This year, things are different. I am taking AP Calculus BC, AP Physics 1, AP English III, AP Seminar, AP Computer Science, AP Chemistry, and AP Art History. In all honesty, I still didn’t do any homework over the weekend, and if I structure my day right, I am able to finish my assignments(working at a moderate pace) before lunch or just after lunch, and I am sure that 4 years from now, sitting in college, I will look back on this year as a breeze, just as I now think of, say, middle school. 
Aside from that, on Thursday I will be attending in person school for one day. Apparently, the school wants the students to meet their teachers, so they are dividing the alphabet by days to minimize the crowd. On Thursday, last names A-C are allowed to attend school, and even if all of them do, the school will still be very socially distanced.
Next, I am taking the SAT on Saturday. I am hoping for a 1600, as I think it is within my abilities if I practice some more and focus. I took 2 full length practice tests over the weekend, and missed 3 English, 1 Math on Test 1, and 2 English, 2 Math on Test 2. Considering that I am very good at SAT Math, and that I started slacking around/browsing the web/not reviewing answers out of boredom when I got to the math section, I am sure I can get that number down to 0. So, aside from math, if I just focus, I think I can avoid the 1 question I am  missing in both Reading and Writing. If all of those steps are followed, I am sure I can get a 1600.
Finally, I would like to discuss an idea circulating in my mind tonight. Today for dinner, my mom made chicken leg-quarters, first baked, then broiled. However, we bought this chicken pre-marinated from HEB, which we have never done before. The chicken was marinated in Southwestern sauce, which I have also never had, or if I did, I can’t recall it. This gave the chicken as a whole and ombre color, from a deep, dark red on the crispier areas of skin, to a more majestic orange in the rest of the skin, and a slow transition to the inner white meat. In all honesty, the chicken that my mom bakes normally is far superior to today’s chicken in terms of taste, texture, and flavor. But, all of those chicken are a standard brown color, so they don’t stick in my memory for very long. But this orange chicken, I just can’t forget it(yes I know it has only been 3 hours).
In all food really, while some people say that their camera eats first, really the eyes eat first. That is why so many people don’t eat things like oatmeal/porridge, or insects, or seafood, etc., because, to them at least, those foods are appealing to their eye, no matter how healthy, tasty, or beneficial others claim they are. In fact, for years, I didn’t eat oatmeal because of its looks, along with its squishy texture. But now, for the past month or so, I have eaten oatmeal almost every day!
I guess my fascination with food, taste, enjoyment, and what people eat really boils down to an interest in psychology and the human brain/ as really, people can eat almost anything and keep living.
Anyway, I don’t even know what I’m saying at this point, and I’ve definitely rambled for to long now. See ya tomorrow. Peace out.
