  <h4>August 24th, 2020</h4>		


  Today was a terrible day, if I do say so myself. In the morning, I woke up bright and early, and worked out, ate oatmeal, and worked on a physics lab. Basically, I was a productivity ninja until around 10AM. That’s when I decided to take a break.
Little did I know that the break would be in effect until 9:30 pm at night, or almost a full 12 hours of chilling. Then at 9:30, expecting a couple tiny assignments, I had to take a Math test, do a chapter of chemistry notes/hw, do an entire AP Art History study guide, and then I still had to do a pechakucha. A pechakucha is basically a presentation/slideshow, but each slide has only 20 seconds, and there are 20 slides, so it is trying to get you to compact as much information as possible.
To be honest, I didn’t even write this on the 24th. I am writing now at 7:00 am on the 25th, as I had to wake up at 5:00 AM to finish my PechaKucha, and last night I was way too tired to do anything.
I think going forward, the goal will be to finish all homework/assignments before lunch, and I think it is 100% possible, even with live conferences and stuff like that.
With that being said, I have to do that now, as a blogger who doesn’t follow their own advice isn’t really a blogger at all. Peace out.
