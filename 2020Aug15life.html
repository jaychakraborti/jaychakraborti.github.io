  <h4>August 15th, 2020</h4>		


  Today I uploaded a Youtube video! Tomorrow, I will wake up early, finish my studying, psat, schoolwork, coding, etc. before basketball, and after basketball, I will make 5 tiktoks, and a Youtube video, which is going to be hella fire. Also, today we rewatched Thor Ragnarok, and it was really good! Other than that, I am still trying to lose some fat, and I stuck to a good eating habit today. I also formed a workout plan which is sustainable, in which I workout muscles 5 times a week, instead of 7, but I keep playing basketball everyday, because I enjoy it, it is good cardio, and I want to be able to dunk/increase vert, and be good at the game all around. Aight, bye.
