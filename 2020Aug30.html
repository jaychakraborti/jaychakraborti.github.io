  <h1 id="title">Alarmy App Review</h2>

  <h4>August 30th, 2020</h4>		


  I have gone through several alarms as a teenager. This includes an old-school alarm clock, the default phone alarm, and even the Google Home Alarm. After a while however, all of these methods have failed me. I am a deep sleeper. And eventually, I find that I am able to turn off these alarms without realizing it, and quickly going back to bed, to fall back into a deep slumber.
  This has changed with Alarmy. In my 2 -3 weeks of use, it has consistently woke me up 100% of the time.
  What is so special about hsi app you might ask? Well, at its roots, it is like a default alarm app. You set a time, and at that time, the phone rings. However, that isnâ€™t all. Before you can end the alarm, you have to do an activity .There are several options, including a puzzle, and math problems. I chose the math problems. From there, you can set how many questions, and how difficult each question should be. What works for me is 5 questions, each of which is the addition of 3 two digit numbers.
  Anyway, I would recommend that you should figure out what problem set works for you, and from then on, say goodbye to the snooze button for good.
