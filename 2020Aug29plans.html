  <h4>August 29th, 2020</h4>		


  To be honest, I donâ€™t know yet how you are reading this message. As of now, I am typing, and have been writing, all of my previous blog entries in a Google Document. But, as of now, my school gave us a 5 day weekend because of power cuts due to Hurricane Laura, so I believe tomorrow I will figure out how to get my website working, then add all my various content, including these blog posts, tweets, insta posts, tiktoks, yt vids, etc.
  Speaking of Hurricane Laura, I believe I told yall last time that I would give you an update. Well, thankfully, for me at least, the storm did exactly what I wanted: nothing. I live in Greater Houston, so it was predicted that the storm would go right through us, bringing many feet of rain as well as flash floods and death. While the storm did wreak havoc, it went between Houston and New Orleans, so much destruction/ loss of life was avoided.
  For me personally, my school was cancelled from the 26th of August to today, the 28th, so, including the weekend, we got 5 days off. I was using this time to practice for the SAT, but sadly/luckily my SAT testing center was closed as there were power outages occurring. On one hand, I am upset that the test is cancelled, as I have been giving a home stretch effort in the past 2 weeks, and a lot of that energy will now be lost. At the same time, I now get extra time to practice and review. As of now, I will take my sat on September 26th instead.
  The last major news story of the day is that Chadwick Boseman, who played Black Panther, Jackie Robinson, and many more people, passed away today due to colon cancer. This year, 2020, seems to get worse by the month, and I am 1000% sure that 50 years from now my grandchildren will be gathered around to hear what it was like. Overall, this year is just dogshit in terms of what is going on, and that is just added to by today's tragic death. However, all of these problems are far out of my control, and to be totally honest, all this time at home is a big opportunity, and the best way to honor those who have died, lost their jobs, gotten sick, saved lives, etc. this year, is to utilize that time and make yourself a better person. Thats all for now. Peace out.
