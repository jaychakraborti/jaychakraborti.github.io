  <h4>August 22nd, 2020</h4>		


  As I mentioned previously, I have the SAT next Saturday, so stakes are getting higher everyday. Today I took a full practice test in one go, instead of partial tests, and I got a 1570, which is pretty good. I missed 2 in reading, 1 in Writing, and one in Math(w/ Calculator). 
That took place first thing in the morning, and since then I have been pretty lazy/ lazy as normal. So, after lunch till now, 9:00 pm, I have been chilling pretty much. While I have been playing basketball almost every day, which I continued today, by practicing for a couple hours, aside from that, the other6 hours were spent in various relaxation activities.
First, after lunch, I watched 3 Idiots, starring Aamir Khan. From there, I decided to tweet for a while, scroll tiktok, reddit, and instagram until about 5pm. After that, I played basketball as I said earlier. 
But since then, I have been binging KSI videos. While I don’t necessarily understand a lot of his references/inside jokes, man is literally the realest youtuber ever, even though he's mega famous/a multi-millionaire. Not only that, his reaction videos are actually super funny, at least to my sense of humor, and he has the type of laugh where once he starts laughing, you can’t help but laugh yourself.
Anyway, today was a moderate day, kinda productive, but also kinda lazy. Anyway, don’t feel like writing anymore, peace out.
