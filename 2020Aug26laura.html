  <h1 id="title">Prepping for Hurricane Laura</h2>

  <h4>August 26th, 2020</h4>		


  It seems that 2020 is going down the drain, day by day, month by month. First Kobe died, then there was Australian wildfires, then all my academic competitions got cancelled(most importantly, Deca ICDC), then the NBA season was ended, then we went into quarantine, then George Floyd was killed, sparking a massive revitalization of BLM, and now a hurricane.
  I have lived in Greater Houston since 2015, so I have definitely seen my fair share of hurricanes/rain. In fact, almost every year, we get a few days of school off as rainy days.
  While it sounds bad to say, I actually look forward to rainy days off of school. In my heart, I know it means that some people had their houses flooded, or were injured, or died, etc, and that is very, very tragic. But for me, I live in a higher elevation area, so I just get to chill with no homework for a while. Writing this down, I now feel like a terrible person.
  Anyways, the most significant hurricane that I lived through was, of course, Hurricane Harvey in 2017. We got a full 11 days off of school, but more than that, about 70 people were killed, billions of dollars of damage were done, and many people lost their homes. What was crazy about Hurricane Harvey is that it actually was not a super powerful storm. Hurricanes are ranked by their wind speed, with a Category 1 storm being weakest, and a Category 5 storm being the strongest. Any storm with wind speeds lower than that of a Category 1 hurricane is classified as a Tropical Storm instead. Hurricane Harvey was a Category 3 storm if I remember correctly, but it stuck over Houston for several days, and in all, something like 40 inches of rain fell in just 3-4 days, which caused all the aforementioned consequences.
  That brings us to Hurricane Laura. To be totally honest, 2 days ago, I hadn't even heard of the storm. Yesterday, I heard how 2 tropical storms were going to hit Houston/Louisiana at the same time, which was a very rare occurrence. Those 2 storms being Tropical Storm Marko and Laura. Then today, people seem to have forgotten about Marko, as it is still a tropical storm. On the other hand, last night and today, tropical storm Laura has intensified into a CATEGORY 4 storm!!
  My family and I spent some time prepping for the worst today. First, we went to Walmart and bought some extra groceries. Then, we found all the candles, batteries, and flashlights in the house and accumulated them in one place. Finally, we removed any loose items from our back and front yard, as well as the upper balcony. This included an outdoor table, chairs, pots, pool equipment, etc.
  Supposedly, the storm will hit later on tonight, and definitely by tomorrow morning. As I am writing, it is 10:41. Throughout the day, there have been sporadic short episodes of rain, but they ended as abruptly as they began. So basically, we are still in the calm before the storm. This is pretty helpful to me though, as my school was cancelled for today and tomorrow on Tuesday, as on Tuesday, it was believed the storm would hit today. 
  I am worried however, that the storm will be devastating and school will be cancelled on Friday, but more than that, I am taking my SAT on Saturday, and that highschool and its surrounding region has been known to flood easily, and I have been practicing so much for the SAT, that if it gets cancelled, it will just be awful.
  Anyway, I will get back to you tomorrow with how the storm ended up being.
