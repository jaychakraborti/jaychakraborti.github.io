  <h1 id="title">Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo</h2>

  <h4>March 13th, 2020</h4>		


  This year was the third year I have gone to the Houston Rodeo. The first year was 2016, then 2019, and into the next decade, now 2020. Each year had its own particular shortcomings. In year one, we didnâ€™t get to see the livestock portion of the event, mainly because we were slightly clueless. In 2019, we showed up so late, we missed all the cool rodeo events, and simply watched mutton busting, where some 5 year olds hold on to a sheep for dear life as long as they can. On top of that, the included concert ticket was for a country musician. No disrespect to country lovers, but country music has never been my genre of choice. The point is, this year we had a lot on our todo list.

Our troop was myself, my sister, and my mother. Aiming to beat the rush hour traffic, we left our house at around 3:30. From there, we jammed out in the car to some fine Bollywood beats, while also stressing about where we would park. Once we reached, parking in the same spot as we had in the previous year, we got our admission wristbands, and boarded the bus to go to NRG stadium.

Upon arrival, our first stop after a quick consultation with the map was the livestock show. We had never been there, so we were all excited. Near the entrance was a petting zoo, filled with alpacas, llamas, goats, and more. Their looks drew us in, but their odor pushed us back out. Next, there was a bee exhibit with a beehive encased in a clear plastic. After that, there was a large parakeet/bird cage, with so many green and assorted colored birds that they had to stand on the walls of their enclosure. From there, it was the star of the show, the large farm animals. Yes, there were pigs, sheep, and best of all, cows. As a suburban kid, the largest animal I had been within 2 feet of was a squirrel. Needless to say, the cows seemed enormous. Many of them were laying down, but others looked at me, doe-eyed. The crowning jewel of the exhibit was definitely the longhorn bull.

This longhorn had absolutely massive horns, and reminded me how much better UT is than the A&M aggiesðŸ˜Ž. After a couple pics with the chilliest longhorn in Houston, we went to the newborn center of the show. Here, a horse was just born minutes before I arrived, and a pig gave birth to a bunch of piglets(gross).

However, the most interesting part of the newborn section was the chicken eggs. These baby chicks were breaking out of their shell in front of our eyes. Imagine your first experience on the planet being waking up to large mammals surrounding you, with strange metal rectangles producing bright flashes of light. At this point it was around 6:30, and the rodeo would start at 6:45, so we decided to go get some food.

While my sister had researched many innovative carnival foods before we came, we were having a hard time locating them. Additionally, I was on the hunt for a turkey leg, which I had eaten every year I had attended the rodeo. After much deliberation and walking, we ended up with chicken on a stick, one for my mom and one for my sister, a turkey leg for me, a large curly fries with cheese for the group, and deep fried chocolate covered strawberries. Iâ€™ll be the first to tell you, the turkey leg and the nacho cheese curly fries were disgusting, and a waste of $20 for sure. But the chicken tenders on a stick and the fried strawberry were both innovative and tasty. At this point, it was around 7:10, so we freaked out and started heading towards the stadium for the rodeo itself.

Before starting the arduous walk up to our seats, we first took pictures with some painted human-sized boots outside the stadium. Our seats this year were pretty solid, they were about halfway up in height, and dead center in the shorter side of the field. Additionally, the Coronavirus fears meant that there were tons of open seats, and I could easily drape my legs over the seat in front of me without any dirty looks.

Events(that I remember with my sleep deprived mind, also the names are probably wrong)
Cattle wrestling: Here 2 horses ride next to a young bull, and the cowboy has to grab the horns and turn, bringing the bull to the ground.
Cattle wrangling: Here the cowboy simply has to lasso the young bull so it falls to the ground.
Bare back bronco bucking: This event is similar to the main event, bareback bull riding, except it is on a horse.
Bare back bull riding: Here the incredibly fearless cowboy has to hold on to the bare back of a bull without being nicked off for 8 seconds, and is graded on his form while bucking.
Barrel racing: This was one event with cowgirls not cowboys. Basically, the challenge was to see which one could run the fastest on their horse around 3 barrels.
Chariot racing: This event was a race between 3 people, each in a Wells Fargo- sequel wagon, pulled by 4 horses. There were two races, so 6 people in total.
Aforementioned mutton busting: nuff said.
After the events, there was some stalling, by having moments to honor the horses/animals, the volunteers, etc etc.

Then, we moved to the concert portion of the day. Our concert was for NCT 127, a KPOP boy band, and actually the first KPOP group to ever perform at the Houston Rodeo. I canâ€™t say I knew their songs, but they did have cool hair. It was floppy, and brightly colored. In fact, they made me consider dying my own hair a strong color sometime in the near future(probably orange, red, or silver). We had lots of their fans in attendance, the Coronavirus didnâ€™t hold them back, and it seemed as if they were all conviently located right behind me. They werenâ€™t, but the screams were so loud anytime one of the members even took a breath, I almost lost my hearing in just a couple of hours. I am a base-lover however, and the base in the stadium was so killer, I can still feel the beats pulsating through my kidneys. The only song I remember being able to distinguish from the crowd noises and the music was called Superhuman, and it was pretty good. I think I actually like KPOP a bit now tbh. Anyways, all good things come to an end, and eventually NCT 127 started telling us how much they loved Houston, Texas, so I knew the night was coming to an end.

This should be where the story end, but sadly I canâ€™t say that. You see, in our tired, mildly-deaf, sleepy minds, we didnâ€™t realize that not only did we get on the wrong bus back to our station, but the wrong type of bus, a charter bus not a metro bus. Thankfully, we had a very kind bus driver, who after we sorted out our confusion took us to our stop, even though it wasnâ€™t on his route. That about sums up Rodeo Houston 2020 I would say. Anyway, goodnight, and I canâ€™t wait to write back with my next adventure.
