  <h1 id="title">Homecoming - Amazon Prime Review</h2>

  <h4>August 28th, 2020</h4>		


  *SPOILERS GALORE*

  I recently completed Homecoming, an Amazon Prime Video Original, and would like to share some feedback.I only watched Season one, but that is the main season anyway. The story follows a veteran named Walter Cruz, who returns from war in Afghanistan to a facility called Homecoming. At Homecoming, he and other participants are told that they are getting PTSD treatment. The majority of lower level staff also believe this. What they don't know(at least at the time) is that the true purpose is to wipe the soldiers memory of war so that they can be redeployed.
  In terms of the background, as in set design, music, and camera work, this show is simply supreme. The eerie music and disturbing surveillance-esque camera shots will have you on the edge of your seat through every episode. Likewise, at the end of each episode, you will be itching to find out what happens next. With that being said, this show isn't my cup of tea. I like shows with a more light spirited feel, with jokes and comedy, like The Office, or House MD. I guess I donâ€™t like the gloomy, suspenseful, thrillers. If that is your type of show however, then you will definitely enjoy homecoming, as it is beautifully shot, and engaging.
