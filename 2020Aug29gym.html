  <h1 id="title">My new gym Routine</h2>

  <h4>August 29th, 2020</h4>		


  For quite some time, I have been trying to wake up at 5:00 AM. The thing is, I don’t feel sleepy until 10:30-11:00 at the earliest. That means, assuming I go to bed at 10:30, and fall asleep instantly, I still only get around 6.5 hours of sleep. To be realistic, with the tossing and turning, I likely only get around 6 hours of sleep on nights like these. This is much too less for me, and I end up napping around midday if I do so. These naps then make me go to sleep later that night, so I am unable to get up at 5:00 the next day. The end result is that I wake up between 8:00 and 9:00 most days, and maybe one day a week, when I feel extra motivated, I wake upa t 5:00 AM. I don’t think that this schedule is beneficial or sustainable, as I ideally should wake up and sleep at around the same time every day. On top of that, if I wake up late, I usually don’t work out, as I usually have stuff to do, and I don’t like to work out in front of others.
  Now, I have decided that I will try a 10:30 to 6:00 sleep schedule instead. When school starts in person again, I will definitely have to shift this schedule an hour or so ahead, but for now I think it is sustainable in quarantine.  This time allows me to workout before everyone is milling about, and, I am sure from there I can always move up earlier to 5 or so if I decide to.
Now, onto the workout routine. I have been pretty inconsistent with my workouts, sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the evening, sometimes not at all. I have been doing the One Punch Man workout - 100 pushups, 100 sit ups, and 100 squats, all modified to different difficulty levels. I now want to add a running portion, as One Punch Man himself did a 10km run as well. However, we don’t have a treadmill at our house, and gyms are not safe during quarantine. I have been playing basketball to make up for this, but I don’t think it is the same. Instead, I will run to my local park, and run up and down the hills they have there. I think running should be helpful in terms of mental and physical endurance, as well as the hill should increase my speed. That's all for now, peace out.
