  <h1 id="title">On Atomic Habits</h2>

  <h4>August 20th, 2020</h4>		


 Recently, I read Atomic Habits by James Clear, and it is safe to say that it has transformed my viewpoint on productivity. Before, I mainly focused on motivation. If I was feeling motivated, then I would work. If I wasn't feeling motivated, then I wouldn't work. However, this strategy has obviously produced any great results in my life. In fact, just the opposite. I had become overweight, lazy, I spent the majority of my free time on social media, and I was just aimed in a bad direction in my life overall. 
    Now however, I believe and understand that the only way to consistently produce high levels of focus, work, and production is habit/routine. Even the most motivated person on the planet, who watches documentaries, reads self help books, and listens to podcasts, still is not motivated every day of their life. But if you turn your actions into habits, then even the most unsuccessful person can do an action everyday. For example, almost all of you(hopefully), are able to brush your teeth every day, rise or shine, happy or sad, no matter the situation.
      Why is this? Why are habits so powerful? Well, this isn't mentioned very much in the book(or maybe it is, I just forgot), but last year I took AP Psychology, so I am moderately informed. While reading for that class, we did learn a unit about habits. Studies show that when people were tested, they performed habits differently than more unique, conscious work. For example, when solving a puzzle, or making a new recipe, the brain activity was in a cortex region, whereas when brushing their teeth, or preparing for bed, a different area of the brain was used. What is important, is that you only have so much conscious attention. You cannot decide whether or not to cook breakfast, what to eat, what to wear, what to bring to school, whether to drive or take the bus, and the vocab for your English quiz all simultaneously, or at least not very successfully. But the area in which habits are formed does not suffer from this problem. You can stack a consistent wake up time, a workout, a shower/ hygiene routine, a breakfast, an outfit, etc. all into a combined morning routine/habit, and perform it every day without even really thinking about it.
        Armed with this new piece of information, I have switched my plans. I now fall asleep constantly between 10 and 11pm, and am trying to consistently wake up at 5 am. I also workout every evening, study/finish schoolwork in the morning, and, as of the last week or so, write a blog post every night before I sleep. 
          While following this new system, I have seen dramatic improvements in the consistency of my work, as I sleep at more stable hours, workout more regularly, post content more regularly, and much more. Additionally, when these activities are formed into habits, and the decision of when to do them is already made, not only does it serve to destress you, but it also frees up cortex space for you to think more deeply about other topics that you are more interested in. For example, if you know what you are going to do in the morning, what you are going to wear, what you are going to eat, and where you are going to go, then that frees up space to work harder, longer, and smarter.
            Overall, not only would I definitely recommend reading Atomic Habits, but also mainly to implement habits into your life for the actions you are trying to take more often/more consistently. For me at least, as well as many others, habits are much more effective than motivation, wishful thinking, etc. If it doesn't work for you, then move on to the next piece of self-help advice. But if it does, then the sky's the limit.
